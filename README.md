Sample site for Udacityâ€™s Intro to jQuery.

Passing a function (callback) to the jQuery object

In case you were curious, the reason you're downloading the website and running it locally instead of running it in the classroom like before is because of the way the Udacity classroom works.

With the way the <iframe> with your modified site loads in the classroom, $(someFunction)'s behavior is exactly the same as simply calling someFunction() like normal. So there isn't really a reason to ask you to try it here.

Also, it looks like placepuppy.it might be down :( Here's another image URL: http://placekitten.com/350/150
